 * useEditor — the editor's state + interaction layer.
 *
 * Owns the CanvasController, the loaded capture, the annotation list, the active
 * tool, selection, and undo/redo history, plus all mouse/keyboard interactions
 * (drawing, selecting, moving, resizing, text, crop, pan/zoom). App.tsx is a
 * thin presentational consumer.
 *
 * History records snapshots of the annotation list, the cut bands, the picture
 * they were measured against and the selection that went with them
 * (history.ts). Each mutating action snapshots the pre-change state (one entry
 * per action — a move/resize drag snapshots on first motion, not per
 * mousemove). Crop rasterises a new picture and moves every surviving
 * annotation into its coordinates, so its entry carries the picture as well as
 * the list: the four are captured together and restored together, which makes
 * a crop one ordinary undo step. A cut is one too, by a cheaper route — it is
 * a band on a list the compose paths read, so it never replaces the picture at
 * all.
