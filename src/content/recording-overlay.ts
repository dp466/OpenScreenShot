 *   each carrying the elapsed read at its own moment), so the later-arriving

  // It stays mounted whether the bar itself is shown or hidden, because the
  // dead zone can be hovered at either moment.
  //
  // It is a real `<button>` with an accessible name, not a decorative,
  // aria-hidden div: `host.inert` takes Stop/Cancel/Pause out of the tab
  // order while hidden (see `applyBarVisibility`), and the unbound
  // `reveal-recording-bar` command only helps a user who has bound it — so
  // this button is the keyboard route every install gets for free, with no
  // manifest change and no manual binding. It is inserted *before* `host`
  // in document order (not appended after, like `camHost`), which is what
  // makes forward-Tab land here first while the bar is hidden and then
  // continue straight into the now-revealed Stop/Cancel/Pause on the very
  // next Tab, rather than tabbing past them. It stays reachable while the
  // bar is hidden because it is `host`'s sibling, not its descendant —
  // `inert` does not travel sideways.
