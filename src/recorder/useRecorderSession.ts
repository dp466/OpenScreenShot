/**
 * useRecorderSession — loads a recording session, drives playback across its
 * segments, and owns the editor state (zoom blocks + trims).
 *
 * Playback model: one `<video>` element per segment is mounted (App.tsx keeps
 * them hidden and draws the active one into the stage canvas); this hook owns
 * which one is active, the timeline playhead, and the play/pause/seek
 * transport. Position is expressed in TIMELINE ms — the trimmed,
 * concatenated view — and mapped to a segment's own clock through
 * `timeline-math`. A rAF loop advances the playhead while playing, because
 * `timeupdate` is too coarse to stop at a trim boundary.
 *
 * A segment with a `webcamUrl` also mounts a second, hidden element (the
 * recorder-#2 blob — real webcam video, or audio-only when the camera was
 * never captured). It rides every seek/play/pause/advance the tab element
 * gets, and the playhead pump force-resyncs it past a drift threshold, the
 * same pattern `export-video.ts` uses to keep two independently playing
 * `<video>` elements from pulling apart over a long recording.
 *
 * Editor state grew, in task 10, to everything `RecorderDraft` persists:
 * `{ zoomBlocks, autoZoomDone, trims, cursor, volumes, bubble, frame }` (task
 * 39 merged what were once two separate fields, `ripple` and `pointer`, into
 * `cursor`). The mutators keep the persisted fields canonical (blocks always
 * run through `normalizeBlocks`, trims always through `clampTrim`); `cursor`,
 * `volumes`, `bubble`, and `frame` are plain pass-throughs whose panels land
 * in later tasks. On load, `parseRecorderDraft(session.editorState)` hydrates
 * this state — including `autoZoomDone` — before the auto-zoom effect below
 * can run, so a session with a saved draft never re-clusters clicks.
 *
 * Undo (task 38) is the reason the mutators are split in two. `commitEditor`
 * is every edit the user makes: it banks the state being replaced on the undo
 * past before writing the new one. `applyEditor` is everything else — the
 * hydration above, the auto zoom's one seeding run, and the clamp a measured
 * segment duration forces — none of which the user did, and none of which may
 * become a step they can undo into a timeline they never had. The stacks
 * themselves live in `recorder-history.ts` and ride the draft, so an undo
 * survives a reload.
 *
 * The persistence effect must not treat hydration itself as an edit (a
 * read-only second tab would otherwise schedule a write 800ms after every
 * open), so `skipNextPersistRef` swallows exactly the one firing that
 * hydration causes; auto-zoom's own first run is a real edit and still
 * schedules a write. Switching sessions (or closing the tab) must not drop
 * an edit still sitting in the debounce window — `pendingRef` tracks the
 * latest unwritten snapshot so `flushPending` can write it synchronously
 * from the load effect's cleanup or the `visibilitychange` handler.
